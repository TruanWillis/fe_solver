## Description
 
2D plane-stress finite element analysis solver. Models are generated by inputting text files in a format similar to a Simulia Abaqus `.inp` file. Keywords are used to define the model in the text file. Available keywords are detailed below.

## How To Use
  
### Installation  

Clone repository using the following https://github.com/koodibaas/fe_solver.git

Python modules provided in `requirements.txt`

User configurable options are provided in _config_user.json_, the following configurable options are available:
1. `print_head` (boolean) - prints the panda's head for normal, principal and von Mises stress results
2. `save_matrix` (boolean) - saves stiffness matrix to _stiffness_matrix,csv_
3. `scale` (integer) - result plot deformation scale

### Running

To run use the following terminal command. 

``` 
python main.py
```

Example `.inp` files are provided in `\inp`

FEsolver GUI provides the following options:
1. `Working directort` - sets working directory
2. `Input file` - select model input file
3. `Generate model` - converts input file keywords to model object
4. `Solve model` - calculates model solution
5. `Plot results` - plots displacement, von mises stress and principal stress on deformed mesh (plots stiffness matrix heat map is `save_matrix = True`)
6. `Quite` - closes GUI

## Keywords
  

#### * BOUNDARY

Specify boundary conditions. This option is used to prescribe boundary conditions at nodes

**Required parameters:**
 
	None

**Optional parameters:**

	None

**Data lines to define boundary:** 

First line:

	Node number or node set label.
	Degree of freedom to constrained.
	Degree of freedom to constrained.
	Boundary value, only required for nonzero boundary condition. 

Repeat this data line as often as necessary to specify boundary conditions at different nodes and degrees of freedom.

#### * CLOAD

Specify concentrated force. This option is used to apply concentrated forces at any node in the model.

**Required parameters:**

	None

**Optional parameters:**

	None  

**Data lines to define concentrated loads for specific degrees of freedom:** 

First line:

	Node number or node set label.
	Degree of freedom.
    Load magnitude.

Repeat this data line as often as necessary to define concentrated loads.

#### * ELASTIC  

Specify elastic material properties.  This option is used to define linear elastic moduli.

**Required parameters:**

	None

**Optional parameters:**

	None

**Data lines to define isotropic elasticity:** 

First line:

	Young's modulus, E.
	Poisson's ratio.

#### * ELEMENT 

Define elements by giving their nodes. This option is used to define an element directly by specifying its nodes.
  
**Required parameter:**

	TYPE

Set this parameter equal to the element type, currently only **S3** element type is availible. 

**Optional parameters:**

	ELSET

Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set to which these elements will be assigned.


**Data lines to define the elements:** 

First line:

	Element number.
	First node number forming the element.
	Second node number forming the element.
	Third node number forming the element.

Repeat this set of data lines as often as necessary.

#### * ELSET  

Assign elements to an element set.  This option is used to assign elements to an element set.

**Required parameter:**  

	ELSET

Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set to which the elements will be assigned.

**Optional parameters:**

	GENERATE

If this parameter is included, each data line should give a first element, _e1_, a last element, _e2_, and the increment in element numbers between these elements, _i_. Then, all elements going from _e1_ to _e2_ in steps of _i_ will be added to the set. _i_ must be an integer.

**Data lines if the GENERATE parameter is omitted:** 

First line:

	List of elements or element set labels to be assigned to this element set. Only previously defined element sets can be assigned to another element set.

Repeat this data line as often as necessary.  

**Data lines if the GENERATE parameter is included:** 

First line:

	First element in set.
	Last element in set.
	Increment in element numbers between elements in the set. The default is 1.

Repeat this data line as often as necessary.

#### * MATERIAL  

Begin the definition of a material. This option is used to indicate the start of a material definition.

**Required parameter:**

	NAME

Set this parameter equal to a label that will be used to refer to the material in the element property options. Material names in the same input file must be unique.

**Optional parameters:**

	None

#### * NODE 

Specify nodal coordinates. This option is used to define a node directly by specifying its coordinates.

**Optional parameters:**

	NSET

Set this parameter equal to the name of the node set to which these nodes will be assigned. Node sets created or modified with this option will always be sorted.

**Data lines to define the node:**

First line:

	Node number.
	First coordinate of the node.
	Second coordinate of the node.

Repeat this data line as often as necessary.

#### * SHELL SECTION  

Specify a shell cross-section. This option is used to specify a shell cross-section.
  
**Required parameter:**

	ELSET

Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set containing the shell elements for which the section behavior is being defined.

	MATERIAL

Set this parameter equal to the name of the material of which the shell is made.  

**Optional parameters:**

	None
